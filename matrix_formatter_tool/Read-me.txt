How I did it for future reference (on a mac) in case you want to pass this on to future students.

Copy matrix out of PDF into word document. Make any necessary edits (fixing things that copied wrong ie Os and Is as explained below. I had to paste in the character states, and then add the names individually to their lines afterwards because it wouldn't copy out properly.

Save stripMatrix.py into home directory
Open terminal
type "python2.6 stripMatrix.py" (without the quotes)
copy and past the matrix
hit CTRL-D

a .csv file will be saved to the home directory which can then be imported into excel. From excel it can be imported into mesquite or whatever else you are using. 

It is sort of frustrating copying out of a PDF. A lot of the 0s were read as Os and 1s were read as Is so I had to manually change them. Every time the code hits a letter it starts a new line in the spreadsheet (because it is looking for letters for the names). Of course, this is unfortunate because it opens up the possibility for human error.
